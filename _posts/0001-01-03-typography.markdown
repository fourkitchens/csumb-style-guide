    <h3><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/whitney/overview/">Whitney</a></h3>
    <p class="purpose">
      Originally developed for New York&lsquo;s Whitney Museum, the Whitney sans-serif
      family balances the needs of editorial typography and elegant signage,
      lending <em>World Pulse</em> a delightfully legible, yet confident voice
      in&nbsp;body&nbsp;copy.</p>
    <p class="largesample">The quintessential <br /> revolution is that <br /> of the spirit.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="typeface gotham">
    <h3><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview/">Gotham</a></h3>
    <p class="purpose">
      A timeless, versatile face with strong capitals drawing inspiration from
      the mid-twentieth century urban landscape and Art Deco aesthetics, Gotham
      supports <em>World Pulse</em> with an energetic yet classic, authoritative
      yet approachable, and modern yet retrospective tone for
      headlines&nbsp;and&nbsp;labels.
    </p>
    <p class="largesample">It is time for women <br /> to band together, take the <br /> power, and heal the Earth.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="typeface archer">
    <h3><a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/archer/overview/">Archer</a></h3>
    <p class="purpose">
      A highly legible slab serif with intriguing italics balancing the modern
      energy of geometric-style slabs with the warmth and approachability commonly
      associated with the antique-style resulting in a comfortable tone, Archer
      speaks with earnestness and charm for the supporting voices of <em>World Pulse</em>,
      ideally suited for blockquotes, comments, citations, and&nbsp;special&nbsp;features.
    </p>
    <p class="largesample">Women will be <br /> healed and turn their <br /> pain to power.</p>
