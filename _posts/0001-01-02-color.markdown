Each color is presented in a primary value, which should be used when possible,
with one shade and two tints. Any of these values may be subsequently tinted or
shaded by 5% using Sass's `lighten()` or `darken()` functions when building UI
components, particularly useful for borders (like the menu or code samples in
this style guide).

_Warm Slate_ should be used as a structural color for text, subtle backgrounds,
or borders, but not as an accent; it is not a branding color.

A <em class="status-green">status green</em> is available in all four values,
however it should only be used in system status messages because of the
cultural associations green has with other colors in this palette.
