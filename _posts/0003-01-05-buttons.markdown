_Class names are subject to change, particularly in this area._

### Primary and Negative/Destructive Buttons
{% include sample.html sample=b1 %}

Primarily, buttons are presented in one of three ways:

* _Positive_ actions like saving, confirming, or posting
* _Negative_ actions like canceling, aborting, or deleting
* _Neutral_ actions like searching, submitting minor forms, filtering, etc. These
  buttons may be styled in additional ways, but a standard `button` tag with no
  additional classes will appear this way.

### Button Sizes
{% include sample.html sample=b2 %}

Buttons may be produced in various sizes on a limited basis, although the
preference is Standard

### Extra Buttons / CTAs
{% include sample.html sample=b3 %}

Two auxiliary classes of buttons are available, leveraging the remaining
[colors in the palette]({% post_url 0001-01-02-color %}). These should not
appear on any primary forms, but may instead be used for CTAs and other
secondary interactive features. For example, "Recommend" on _Journal_ posts.

_These class names should be changed once a more suitable purpose or class of
action is determined. Usage of these buttons because the implementor likes the
color is strongly discouraged._
