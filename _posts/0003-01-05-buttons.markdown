### Primary and Negative/Destructive Buttons
{% include sample.html sample=b1 %}

Primarily, buttons are presented in one of three ways:

* _Positive_ actions like saving, confirming, or posting
* _Negative_ actions like canceling, aborting, or deleting
* _Neutral_ actions like searching, submitting minor forms, filtering, etc. These
  buttons may be styled in additional ways, but a standard `button` tag with no
  additional classes will appear this way.

### Button Sizes
{% include sample.html sample=b2 %}

Buttons may be produced in various sizes on a limited basis, although the
preference is Standard

### Multiline Buttons
{% include sample.html sample=b3 %}

Content limitations are necessary for multiline buttons.

### Full Width Buttons
{% include sample.html sample=b4 %}

Full width buttons now just have more padding, so small words, Ex. "Yes" don't look too teeny.
