_@TODO: Does this symbol feel right? I'm looking for a cross-cultural resonance
for "help", "stop", "inappropriate", or "danger" without veering into imagery that
may be associated with law enforcement, police, or violence (like shields, badges,
etc.). This might not be stark enough, however. This arises from
[discussion about the flag icon looking "fun" or for "upvoting"](https://notableapp.com/posts/819002#annotate/819002)._
